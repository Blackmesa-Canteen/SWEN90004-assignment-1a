1.  Problem: java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException.
    Reproduction: If I don't cover wait() and notify() codes with synchronized
    Possible Reason:
    Solution: cover wait() and notify() codes with synchronized block.

2. Problem: Heros can not get new missions from mission queue.
   Reproduction: If 4 heroes enter the room, but there are only 3 new missions. One of the hero has to wait the new
        mission. But even the new missions are added in the queue, the hero can not get it.
   Possible Reason: The mission dequeue data structure (LinkedList) in the Roster is not thread-safe. Adding and removing nodes
        in the multi-thread may lead to dead nodes. In this scenario, JDK 11 uses tail-insertion to the linked list, so the last node reference
        pointed to the new inserted missions, and using head node reference to remove missions. However, in this multi-thread condition,
        linked list made the successor node of head node to null, but continued inserting new missions to last node. Since head node's successor
        was always null, so the new added missions are in dead nodes.
   Solution: Replace LinkedList with ConcurrentLinkedDeque, or make addMission and removeMission synchronized.
